        "description": "The Hrvatska nogometna liga, abbreviated as HNL and also known for sponsorship reasons as the SuperSport HNL, is the top Croatian professional football league competition, established in 1992. It was previously called Prva Hrvatska nogometna liga, but a league structure reorganization from 2022-23 led to name changes for the three top league levels. The league was formed in 1991, following the independence of Croatia and the creation of a separate Croatian league from the Yugoslav First League. The first season started in February 1992 and ended in June 1992. A total of twelve clubs contested the league and at the end of the season no teams were relegated as it was decided that the league would expand to 16 clubs for the following season. This was followed by another expansion to 18 teams in 1993-94 season, highest number of participating teams in Prva HNL history. The following season, number of teams was reduced again to 16. Players in the Prva HNL compete for the Prva HNL Top scorer trophy, awarded to the top scorer at the end of each season. Former Dinamo Zagreb striker Igor Cvitanović held the record for most Prva HNL goals with 126 until April 2012. Cvitanović finished among the top ten goal scorers in 7 out of his 11 seasons in the Prva HNL and won the top scorer title two times. During the 1997-98 season, he became the first player to score 100 Prva HNL goals. On 14 April 2012, Davor Vugrinec scored his 127th goal and surpassed Cvitanović's record. ",
